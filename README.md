### Summary

The goal of this project was to recreate a portion of the [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/). In order to make all of the borders, pictures, and extra styling line up according to the example, I had to utilize several wrapper `div`s on each picture. This was definitely a challenging CSS project. I also made the project responsive by adding media queries to shrink images on smaller screens.
